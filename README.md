# SETUP
Inside unity_method_definitions.cpp(TODO: CHANGE THIS LOCATION), setup ur
project path vars at the top of the file.

NOTE: sometimes the unity dll reloader plugin doesn't unload the unity dll, just tab back in and out to fix this
Sometimes if you remove a method definition and there is an error inside unity, you will need to restart unity to be able to write 
to the plugin dll
